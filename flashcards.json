    {"question": "What is the difference between var, let, and const?", "answer": "var and let are similar in that they both allow you to declare variables, but let is the new way of declaring variables. The main difference is that the scope of a var variable is its current execution context, which is either the enclosing function or, for variables declared outside any function, global. On the other hand, let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. const is a signal that the identifier wonâ€™t be reassigned."},
